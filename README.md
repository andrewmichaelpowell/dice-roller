Dice Roller  

This applications allows you to roll dice for tabletop role-playing games.  It features buttons for each of the standard polyhedral dice, as well as a number pad for entering custom rolls.  There is also a tool for use with games that incorporate a D10 die pool + difficulty system.  

I originally created v1 of this project in 1990 in BASIC for the Tandy PC-8 pocket computer. Version 1 took the input of the die pool and type, and returned the roll result.  In 1997, I created v2 for Windows 95 using Visual Basic 5.  Version 2 added the GUI interface.  In 2008, I created v3 using Visual C# for .NET 2.0.  Version 3 added the D10 system tool.  The current release is optimized for .NET 9.0.
